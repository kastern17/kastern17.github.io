                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Giuseppe Verdi (1813 - 1901)</h3>
                <p>Giuseppe Verdi was more than a composer; he was a force of nature in 19th-century Italy. Born in the small village of Le Roncole, Verdi rose from modest beginnings to become a central figure in Italian opera, with masterpieces like Rigoletto, La Traviata, and Aida cementing his legacy. His music resonated deeply with the Italian people, intertwining with the nation's cultural and political fabric during the Risorgimento, the movement for Italian unification. The chorus "Va, pensiero" from his opera Nabucco became an unofficial anthem for the cause, symbolizing the longing for freedom and unity.</p>
                <p>Verdi's personal life was marked by profound tragedies, including the loss of his first wife and their two young children. These experiences of grief and resilience profoundly influenced his compositions, infusing them with emotional depth and authenticity. His Messa da Requiem stands as a testament to his ability to channel personal sorrow into universal expressions of mourning and hope.</p>
                <p>Beyond the stage, Verdi was a man of the people. He served briefly in the Italian parliament and was known for his philanthropic efforts, including the establishment of a retirement home for musicians in Milan. His commitment to both his art and his country made him a beloved national figure.</p>
                <p>As we experience Verdi's Requiem, we are reminded of the man behind the music - Verdi was a composer whose life and work continue to inspire and move audiences around the world.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Verdi’s Messa da Requiem: Operatic Grandeur in Sacred Form</h3>
                <p>Giuseppe Verdi’s Messa da Requiem is a towering fusion of sacred ritual and operatic fire - music of immense power, spiritual depth, and dramatic tension. Premiered on May 22, 1874, in the Church of San Marco in Milan under Verdi’s own baton, the work was composed in memory of Alessandro Manzoni, the revered Italian author of I Promessi Sposi. Verdi’s admiration for Manzoni was profound, and the Requiem stands not only as a tribute to a national hero but also as a personal outpouring of grief transformed into musical majesty.</p>
                <p>The Requiem has its roots in an earlier endeavor. In 1868, following the death of Gioachino Rossini, Verdi proposed a collaborative Requiem involving several Italian composers. He contributed the final movement, Libera me, but the project fell apart before it could be performed. When Manzoni died five years later, Verdi revisited and expanded that music, ultimately weaving it into the heart of a full-length Requiem Mass to be performed on the first anniversary of Manzoni’s death. The result is a work that straddles worlds - profoundly liturgical in text, unmistakably theatrical in style.</p>
                <p>Though cast in the traditional structure of the Roman Catholic funeral mass, Verdi’s Requiem bursts with operatic color and dramatic pacing. The orchestra is rich and expansive, featuring double winds, four bassoons, a piccolo, off-stage and on-stage trumpets, four horns, three trombones, and a cimbasso, along with timpani and a thundering bass drum. The orchestration is not mere embellishment - it plays an integral role in the storytelling. In the infamous Dies irae, massive fortissimo timpani and bass drum strokes evoke the terror of the Last Judgment, while off-stage trumpets in the Tuba mirum surround the audience in a sonic halo of apocalyptic alarm.</p>
                <p>Verdi’s dynamic range in the score is extreme. Markings stretch from hushed pppp to explosive ffff, each dynamic shift infused with dramatic intent. These aren’t ornamental contrasts - they serve the emotional and rhetorical flow of the work. The opening Requiem aeternam emerges from near silence, setting a tone of stillness and reverence. But that serenity shatters moments later with the first shattering Dies irae, a motif that recurs throughout the Mass like a fearful memory returning unbidden.</p>
                <p>Equally striking is Verdi’s writing for voices. The four soloists - soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor, and bass - move fluidly between operatic expressiveness and chamber-like intimacy. In the Agnus Dei, the soprano and mezzo begin with a stark, unaccompanied duet in octaves, which the chorus and flutes gently mirror, lending the moment a sense of raw vulnerability. Later, in the Lux aeterna, three soloists sing a delicate a cappella trio that suggests timelessness through transparency. The Sanctus, by contrast, is an exuberant double fugue performed by a divided chorus, bursting with contrapuntal energy that rivals any operatic finale.</p>
                <p>Despite its sacred text, the Requiem has largely found its home on the concert stage rather than in liturgical services. Its sheer scale, theatrical pacing, and expressive intensity demand a setting where the music can resonate fully - both physically and emotionally. Hans von Bülow famously dismissed it as “an opera in clerical dress”, a jab that nonetheless highlights the boldness of Verdi’s approach. Yet it is precisely this fusion of forms - sacred gravity and operatic immediacy - that gives the work its enduring force.</p>
                <p>Recent performances underscore its undiminished impact. A 2024 BBC Proms performance under Ryan Bancroft was praised for its “blazing force and compelling drama”, while Riccardo Muti’s 2025 appearance at London’s Royal Festival Hall was hailed as a “major musical event”, with demand for tickets surpassing supply. These reactions are not new. From its first performance, the Requiem has captivated audiences - stirring awe, reflection, and, often, tears.</p>
                <p>Verdi’s Messa da Requiem stands today as a masterwork not just of 19th-century choral music, but of the entire Western canon. Its success lies in its refusal to compromise: it honors its sacred text while allowing the full power of musical drama to illuminate its themes. At its heart, it is a deeply human work - one that grapples with grief, fear, hope, and transcendence. In setting Manzoni’s memory to music, Verdi created something larger than a monument: he gave us a mirror through which we see our own mortality, and a voice—our own voice—crying and pleading into God’s eternity.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>The Palisades Symphony was started in 1966 by Joel B. Lish. In 1965 Joel was hired to teach music at Palisades High School. Finding that he had some very good music students at Pali High, Joel started the orchestra in order to provide them with an additional opportunity to play orchestral music. In this endeavor, Joel was incredibly fortunate to meet Eva Holberg, a Pacific Palisades music-lover and volunteer, who became the President of the orchestra and ran it successfully for more than 50 years until her death at 91 in 2022.</p>
                <p>After he retired from full-time teaching in 1995, Joel had more time to devote to his other career as a professional violist. He performed casual, strolling, chamber, and orchestral music with many ensembles, and he also played on many films and television shows. He conducted other groups, such as the Los Angeles Mandolin Orchestra and the Casa Italiana Opera Company. Joel also made wonderful arrangements for string ensembles—duets, trios and quartets.</p>
                <p>The Palisades Symphony always stood at the center of Joel’s activities. It is a true community orchestra, as all musicians volunteer their services. Joel was gratified to know that his beloved orchestra would be able to continue under the very capable leadership of Denisa Hanna and Dr. Maxim Kuzin.</p>

                <p>The Brentwood Palisades Chorale was founded in 1963 as one of the Adult Choruses of the City of Los Angeles. As such, the choir practiced under the direction of the late Frances Cain and performed not only with the Palisades Symphony, but also with the Brentwood Symphony, the Beach Cities Symphony, and the City of Los Angeles Combined Choruses at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. After the spring concert in 1987, Ms. Cain retired, and Susan S. Rosenstein was selected to be the Chorale’s director. The singers rehearse from September through May and perform with the orchestra each year in December and May. In its almost 60 years, the Chorale has performed with the Palisades Symphony and has introduced most of the classical choral literature to the Palisades and surrounding communities, all free of charge. The chorale will begin rehearsing its next concert at the end of this summer. New members are always welcome (no audition is required!) and may request information at any time by emailing Susan Rosenstein at <a href="mailto:brentwoodpalisadeschorale@gmail.com">brentwoodpalisadeschorale@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Acknowledgments</h2>
            <p>We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Wilshire Boulevard Temple Resnick Family Campus, Belmont Village Senior Living in Westwood, and the Palisades Lutheran Church for their wonderful generosity and for providing a welcoming home for our orchestra and chorus.</p>
            <p>After the fire our performances might have stopped altogether and our Palisades musicians would have scattered to other opportunities if it were not for the help and generosity of many others. Our 130 members are grateful to all who expressed interest and for their physical and financial support.</p>
